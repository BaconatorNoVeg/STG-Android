# Smite Team Generator End of Life Notice

*Last updated November 27, 2020*



**TLDR: This app is deprecated. The new version is over [here](https://smitebuilder.app).**



Smite Team Generator was intended to be a hobby project for myself back in 2017, and it still is. Unfortunately, this hobby project has become a chore for me to maintain. I no longer enjoy working on this app. I want to move on to other projects. I'm EOLing Smite Team Generator because of this. While I do appreciate the feedback on the app in the Google Play reviews, both positive and negative, many people want things in the app that I just never intended to put in the app. As I said, this app was meant to be a fun hobby project for myself, and it was for a time. I mostly made it to use when I played Smite myself.  

Times change. I don't play Smite very much anymore, and I don't do much Java programming anymore. I'm about to graduate college and get a career in the Computer Science field. I have many other hobby projects I actually enjoy working on and I'd much rather keep working on those than maintain this free, ad-less app. I'm not going to lie to myself; there are many departments in which this app is lacking, but I lack the motivation to improve those parts of the app.  

It's not all bad news, though. Over the past several months, I've been working on a new web version of this app that has fairly similar functionality. Unlike the Android app, I actually enjoy working on this new version. It's also a lot easier for me to maintain and push updates than the Android version. It also works on all platforms (Android, iOS, Desktop), unlike the Android version. You'll be able to find this new web version at [https://smitebuilder.app](). Keep in mind that this itself is another hobby project of mine and will most likely have an EOL of its own in the future, but for now, that's probably not anytime soon.  

All that being said, thank you for being a user of this app. Thank you to everyone who reviewed the app. Thanks for all the positive feedback. Smite Team Generator was one of my biggest projects (and in a way it still is), and I'll probably never forget about it.
