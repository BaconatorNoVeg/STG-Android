Starting with version 0.4.0, this will require [STG-Lib](https://github.com/BaconatorNoVeg/STG-Lib).

Do you play Smite? Do you get bored playing the same god over and over again? Do you ever find it difficult to choose a new god
to play? Do you want to have a lot more fun when playing in parties? If you answered 'yes' to any of these questions, this is
the app for you!

Smite Team Generator is written completely in Java for the Android platform. It is an application that generates a team of random gods, each with random item builds, for the Hi-Rez Studios MOBA, Smite. Currently, there are no plans for an iOS release of the app, but that may change in the future.

## Features
- Generates a random team of 1 to 5 players
- Generates a random build for each teammate
- Choose how builds are generated through settings
- Share individual players or the whole team to a messaging app of your choice
- Reroll individual players or the whole team
- More features coming soon
